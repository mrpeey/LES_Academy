    "## Analysis\n",
    "For the task of sorting a list of dictionaries by a specific key, the AI-powered code completion tool (GitHub Copilot) suggested using Python’s built-in sorted() function with a lambda function as the key. This approach is concise, readable, and leverages Python’s highly optimized Timsort algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). In contrast, the manual implementation uses a double for-loop to compare and swap elements, resulting in a time complexity of O(n²). This makes the manual approach significantly slower for larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI-suggested code is not only more efficient but also more maintainable and less error-prone. Built-in functions like sorted() are thoroughly tested and optimized in the Python standard library, whereas manual sorting algorithms are more susceptible to bugs and inefficiencies. Additionally, the AI-generated code is more Pythonic, adhering to best practices and idiomatic usage of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the AI-powered code completion provides a solution that is both faster and more reliable. It demonstrates the advantage of using modern code completion tools, which can quickly suggest optimal solutions that might take longer to write and debug manually. For production code, the AI-suggested approach is clearly superior.\n",
